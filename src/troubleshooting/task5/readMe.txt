Tried to read the file by Stream api and by Scanner. In both cases Eclipse MAT complained that 'The memory is accumulated in one instance of "java.lang.Object[]" loaded by "<system class loader>". I think that is what you get when trying to collect all words from a file in on instance of List. I don't consider this a problem because Java needs to create object for every word. Of course there are tools to read big files with lesser memory consumption (such libs as Guava and apache give you this opportunity), but that is what we have when writing code like this... or maybe I'm just wrong and don't understand something.
